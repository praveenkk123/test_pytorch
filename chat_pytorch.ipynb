    "\n",
    "When deploying LLM applications on Intel XPU hardware, several performance factors should be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **XPU Acceleration**: Our code detects and uses available Intel XPU hardware for acceleration\n",
    "2. **Model Size**: Larger models generally produce better results but require more memory resources\n",
    "3. **Precision**: We use `torch.float16` (half precision) to reduce memory usage and improve speed\n",
    "4. **Intel Extensions for PyTorch**: You can further optimize with Intel Extensions for PyTorch (IPEX)\n",
    "5. **Batch Processing**: For handling multiple requests, batching can improve throughput\n",
    "6. **Model Quantization**: Further reducing precision (e.g., to int8) can improve performance on XPU\n",
    "7. **Prompt Engineering**: Well-designed prompts can reduce the number of tokens needed for good results"
